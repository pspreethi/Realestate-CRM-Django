                        That�s up to you! For sure, home shopping today is easier today than ever before. The ability to search for homes online and see pictures, even before setting a foot outside the comfort of your living room, has completely changed the home buying game. Convenience is at an all-time high. But, nothing beats visiting a home to see how it looks and �feels� in person.

                    <summary>What are the steps for home buying process?</summary>
                    <p class="text">
                        First thing is how much you can afford to buy a property,<br>
                        secondly how much you can borrow from different resources,<br>
                        next the loan estimate from your lender will show how much money is required for the down payment and closing costs.Most of our agents will require a pre-approval before showing homes - this is especially true at the higher end of the real estate market; sellers of luxury homes will only allow pre-screened (and verified) buyers to view their homes.<br>
                        This is meant to keep out "Looky Lous" and protect the seller�s privacy. What�s more, by limiting who enters their home, sellers are given extra security from potential thieves trying to case the home (like identifying security systems, locating expensive artwork or other high-value personal property).
